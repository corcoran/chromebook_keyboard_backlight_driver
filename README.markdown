#Chromebook Keyboard backlight driver for Linux 3.x. / 4.1.x

Since the newest Linux Kernel(3.12) ships with Chromebook Pixel support, both touchscreen and touchpad all work fine, but kernel doesn't include the keyboard backlight driver. So I pick the driver form [https://github.com/brocktice/pixel_linux](https://github.com/brocktice/pixel_linux) and make it standalone, easy to use.

##Requirements
* Google Chromebook Pixel or Dell
    Chromebook 13 with Linux installed.
* Build toolchains.  


##Know issue
If we register the keyboard backlight device as `backlight` to Linux system, Gnome will be confused with LCD backlight and Keyboard backlight, In system setting panel, display brightness adjust will be operated on Keyboard Backlight.
So, we register it as `leds` devices to system to make Gnome happy.

##How to install

Clone the code 

if you want the keyboard backlight works like an `backlight` then edit `pixel_kb_backlight.c` 

	#ifdef KB_BACKLIGHT
	#define DEVICE_NAME "chromeos-keyboard-backlight"
	#else
	#define DEVICE_NAME "chromeos-keyboard-leds"
	#endif

Change these and the driver will act as `backlight` or `leds`.

Build with:

	make

You will get 3 drivers:
	chromeos_keyboard_bl.ko  	#backlight class driver
	chromeos_keyboard_leds.ko   #leds class driver
	chromebook_kb_backlight.ko		#keyboard backlight device driver
	
Now, you can load the drivers:

if you choose `backlight`

	sudo insmod chromeos_keyboard_bl.ko
	sudo insmod chromebook_kb_backlight.ko

if you choose `leds`

	sudo insmod chromeos_keyboard_leds.ko
	sudo insmod chromebook_kb_backlight.ko

OK, check whether the drivers load succsefully:

if you choose `backlight`

	ls /sys/class/backlight
	
if you choose `leds`

	ls /sys/class/leds
	

If you can see `keyboard_backlight` or `chromeos::kbd_backlight` from `ls` output, It works!

###How to use
I have put a helper shell script to adjust the backlight level
**You need edit the script if you choose `backlight`, to use the correct path**

	# turn on the backlight
	sudo ./keyboard_brightness.sh on
	
	#turn off the backlight
	sudo ./keyboard_brightness.sh off
	
	#turn up 
	sudo ./keyboard_brightness.sh up
	
	#turn down
	sudo ./keyboard_brightness.sh down
	


##For `leds` as sample:
###Make it load automaticlly while system boot

I install Ubuntu 13.10 with Linux kernel 3.12.0-031200-generic, so I do the following:

	#copy our drivers to the kernel's modules dir
	sudo cp chromeos_keyboard_leds.ko /lib/modules/3.12.0-031200-generic/
	sudo cp chromebook_kb_backlight.ko /lib/modules/3.12.0-031200-generic/
	
	#tell system we have new modules
	sudo depmod -a
	sudo modprobe module
	
then edit `/etc/modules` and add two lines:

	chromeos_keyboard_leds
	chromebook_kb_backlight

Just reboot the laptop, the keyboard backlight driver will load automaticlly.

###Enjoy!
